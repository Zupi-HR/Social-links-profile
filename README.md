### What I learned

This project was a great opportunity to practice responsive design and solidify my understanding of which CSS units to use for different purposes. I focused on creating a fluid and accessible layout that adapts to various screen sizes.

One of the key techniques I implemented was using the `clamp()` function for fluid typography. This allows the font size to scale smoothly with the viewport width between a minimum and maximum value, which is more efficient than writing multiple media queries.

```css
.profile-card__name {
  font-size: clamp(1.5rem, 1.2rem + 1vw, 1.75rem);
}
```

I also made deliberate choices for other units throughout the project:

- **`rem`**: Used for most `font-size`, `padding`, and `margin` values. This ensures the layout scales predictably with the user's browser font-size settings, which is crucial for accessibility.
- **`%`**: Used for the main card's `width` and the avatar's `width` to make them fluid and responsive to their parent container's size.
- **`vh`**: Used on the `body`'s `min-height` to ensure the content card is always centered vertically, even on short content pages.
